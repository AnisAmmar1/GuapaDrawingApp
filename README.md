# Frontend Framework: React.js
# Choice: React.js

** Reason: **

+ React.js was chosen as the frontend framework due to its component-based architecture, which promotes modular and reusable code.
+ React's virtual DOM enhances performance by efficiently updating only the changed parts of the UI, providing a smooth drawing experience.
+ A large and active community around React ensures good support and a plethora of third-party libraries.

# Backend: Node.js and Express.js
# Choice: Node.js and Express.js

** Reason: **

+ Node.js was chosen for the backend due to its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, which is well-suited for applications with real-time features like drawing.
+ Express.js simplifies the creation of robust APIs, providing a minimal and flexible framework.

# Data Storage: MongoDB
# Choice: MongoDB

** Reasons : **

+ MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that provides flexibility in handling unstructured or semi-structured data, making it suitable for storing drawings or image data.
+ Its scalability and ability to handle large amounts of data would be beneficial in a production environment where the application may have a substantial user base.
+ MongoDB's JSON-like documents could be used to store drawing data, making it easy to map between the application's data model and the database.
